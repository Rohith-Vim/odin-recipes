A simple HTML website showcasing a few of my favourite recipes. This was made as part of the Foundations course for the Odin Project.

Clicking on a recipe link will tell you a little bit about it, before detailing the ingredients you'll need and instructions to follow to make 1 serving.

Each page provides credits to the original creator of the image and recipe.
