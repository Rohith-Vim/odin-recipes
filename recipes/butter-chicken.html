    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani, is an Indian dish originating in Delhi. Butter chicken is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. Its sauce is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.</p>
    <p>The chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt), Kashmiri red chili, salt, garam masala, ginger paste, and garlic paste. The marinated chicken is cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, oven-roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato, garlic, and ginger-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is velvety smooth.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>Marinade</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup plain yoghurt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tsp tumeric powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp chilli powder or cayenne pepper powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger, freshly grated</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>750 g chicken thigh fillets</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Curry</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp (30 g) ghee or butter</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato passata</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy / thickened cream</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinade:</strong> Combine the Marinade ingredients with the chicken in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours (minimum 3 hrs).</li>
        <li><strong>Cook chicken:</strong> Heat the ghee (butter or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan. Take the chicken out of the Marinade but do not wipe or shake off the marinade from the chicken (but don’t pour the Marinade left in the bowl into the fry pan).</li>
        <li>Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the chicken is white all over (it doesn’t really brown because of the Marinade).</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> Add the tomato passata, cream, sugar and salt. Also add any remaining marinade left in the bowl. Turn down to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Do a taste test to see if it needs more salt.</li>
        <li>Garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves if using. Serve with basmati rice or naan.</li>
    </ol>
